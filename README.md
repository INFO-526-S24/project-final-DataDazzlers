TUCSON CAR COLLISION ANALYSIS:

Final project repo for INFO 526 - Spring 2024.

INTRODUCTION:

The primary goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly, visualization tool that provides detailed insights into the frequency, severity, and causes of traffic accidents in Tucson.

DATA SET:

We utilize the GIS Data from the City of Tucson, which includes records of car crashes from the Tucson Police Department that are accessible to the public and span the years 2018 through 2023.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Develop a user-friendly dashboard using Quarto that enables users to explore and gain insights from the accident data based on various criteria such as time period and accident severity.

Implement Leaflet to incorporate interactive maps within the dashboard.

These maps will display clustered accident data and allow users to identify accident hotspots within Tucson using latitude and longitude coordinates from the dataset.
 
Utilize ggplot2 and Plotly to create both dynamic and static visualizations within the dashboard.
 
These visualizations should be adjustable based on user preferences and criteria, enhancing the user's ability to understand and analyze the accident data effectively.
