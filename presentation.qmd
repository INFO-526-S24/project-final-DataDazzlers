## Introduction

::: incremental
-   The primary goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly visualization tool that provides detailed insights into the frequency, severity, and causes of traffic accidents in Tucson.

-   **GIS Data from the City of Tucson** - This dataset contains publicly-available records of vehicle collisions from the Tucson Police Department, covering the period from March 2022 to the present.

-   Key variables in this dataset include: Date of collision, Injury severity, Manner of collision, Fatality status
:::

## Question 1

::: incremental
::: {.incremental width="40%"}
-   Does day of the week and/or time of day affect severity and the number of accidents?

-   Key variables to use:

    -   TimeOccu (time at which accident occurred)
    -   Day (day of week accident occurred)
    -   InjurySeverity (how serious the injury caused by accident was)

-   ::: incremental
    These variables may help us explore why certain days of the weeks or times of day lead to more accidents.

## Approach

::: incremental
-   Development of Interactive Visualizations :
    -   Utilize R Shiny for the creation of an interactive dashboard, allowing users to filter and explore the data based on specific criteria (e.g., time period, accident severity).
    -   Implement Leaflet for interactive maps to display spatial data and identify accident hotspots within Tucson using the latitude and longitude coordinates in the dataset.
    -   Use ggplot2 and Plotly for creating dynamic and static visualizations that can be adjusted according to user input.
:::

## Question 2

::: incremental
-   What is the relationship between the type of violation and if the accident resulted in a fatality?

-   Key variables to use:

    -   FatalCollision
    -   TotalFatalities

-   We will create a series of stacked bar plots that show the number of accidents based the type of violation. Pie charts may be included to provide a high-level summary of the percentage of crashes per violation type.
:::

## Approach for Question 2

::: incremental
-   Same as the first question:

    -   Utilize R Shiny for the creation of an interactive dashboard, allowing users to filter and explore the data based on specific criteria (e.g., time period, accident severity).
    -   Implement Leaflet for interactive maps to display spatial data and identify accident hotspots within Tucson using the latitude and longitude coordinates in the dataset.
    -   Use ggplot2 and Plotly for creating dynamic and static visualizations that can be adjusted according to user input.
