However, weekends do see an increase in accidents in the afternoon/evening as well.\n\n        ![](images/question_1_part_2.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Question 2\n\n::: incremental\n-   What is the relationship between the type of violation and if the accident resulted in injury or fatality?\n\n-   Key variables to use:\n\n    -   Fatal Collision (if collision resulted in fatality, yes/no)\n    -   Total Fatalities (number of fatalities due to accidents)\n    -   Injury Severity (how serious the injury caused by accident was)\n    -   Violation/Operator Variables (intersection, speeding, impairment, and distracted)\n:::\n\n## Injury Severity {.smaller}\n\n-   It is observed that 50.2% of accidents do not result in injury.\n-   However, 49.8% of drivers do experience injury from car accidents in Tucson. The most common injury types are non-incapacitating injury and possible injury.\n-   It is also seen that 1.6% of accidents with fatal injury.\n\n![](images/injury_severity.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Collision reason {.smaller}\n\n-   The most common location of collisions is at intersections (74.7%).\n\n-   38.1% of collisions involve a distracted driver, 18.5% involve a speeding driver, and 6.9% involve an impaired driver.\n\n![](images/question_2_part_2.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Conclusion {.smaller}\n\nIdentification of High-Risk Areas: The dashboard effectively pinpoints traffic violation hotspots, aiding in route planning and increasing awareness of dangerous zones.\n\n-   Enhanced Safety Measures: It empowers users, especially universities, to take specific actions like improving pedestrian safety through better lighting, signage, and enforcement around high-risk areas.\n\n-   Informed Decision-Making: By visualizing traffic data, the dashboard supports data-driven decisions that can lead to a significant reduction in traffic-related incidents.\n\n-   Overall Impact: This tool is a valuable asset for promoting safer driving behaviors and enhancing road safety for drivers and pedestrians alike.\n\n## Thank You\n\n![](images/thank_you.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
