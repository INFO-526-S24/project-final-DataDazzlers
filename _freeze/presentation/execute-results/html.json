These years will be plotted as separate lines.\n\n    -   Heat map of accidents by hour and day of the week.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Question 1 Results and Key Observations\n\n### Monthly Time Series\n\n-   Tucson experiences the most accidents in 2019 compared to any other year. 2020 sees the least amount of accidents.\n\n-   Fewer accidents occur in summer months than winter months.\n\n    ![](images/yearly_plot.PNG)\n\n### Hourly Heat Map\n\n-   Weekdays see higher frequencies of car accidents than weekends.\n\n-   For weekdays (Monday - Friday), most accidents occur from 1pm to 6 pm. However, weekends do see an increase in accidents in the afternoon/evening as well.\n\n    ![](images/question_1_part_2.PNG)\n\n## Question 2\n\n::: incremental\n-   What is the relationship between the type of violation and if the accident resulted in a fatality?\n\n-   Key variables to use:\n\n    -   FatalCollision\n    -   TotalFatalities\n\n-   Plot Approach:\n\n    -   Stacked bar plots that show the number of accidents based the type of violation.\n\n    -   Pie charts to provide a high-level summary of the percentage of crashes per violation type.\n:::\n\n## Question 2 Results and Key Observations\n\n### Injury Severity (Stacked bar plots)\n\n-   It is observed that 50.2% of accidents do not result in injury.\n-   However, 49.8% of drivers do experience injury from car accidents in Tucson. The most common injury types are non-incapacitating injury and possible injury.\n-   It is also seen that 1.6% of accidents with fatal injury.\n\n![](images/injury_severity.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Collision reason (Pie Chart)\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   The most common location of collisions is at intersections (74.7%), showing that caution must be taken in these areas.\n\n-   38.1% of collisions involve a distracted driver and 18.5% involve a speeding driver.\n\n-   For the future, it would be interesting to see how different collision reasons are correlated. For instance, do distracted drivers tend to speed? This could potentially help introduce stricter regulations on phone use, for example.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](images/question_2_part_2.PNG){fig-align=\"right\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Thank You\n\n![](images/thankyou.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
