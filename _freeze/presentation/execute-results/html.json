Pie charts may be included to provide a high-level summary of the percentage of crashes per violation type.\n:::\n\n## Collision Severity\n\n-   50.2% of accidents without injury\n-   1.6% of accidents with fatal injury\n\n![](images/bar.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Collision Reason\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   74.4% of collisions involve Intersection\n\n-   38.1% of collisions involve Distracted Driver\n\n-   Intersections are the most dangerous locations\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](images/pies.png){fig-align=\"right\" width=\"116mm\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Thank You\n\n![](images/thankyou.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
