This dataset was selected for its relevance in the context of a worrying increase in road accidents over the past 30 years. Analyzing this data could reveal patterns that would enable the creation of algorithms or models capable of predicting crashes. Such predictive tools could significantly aid in preventing accidents and potential fatalities. By examining this data, we aim to contribute by identifying the places and times where accidents are likely to occur, thereby enhancing public safety and ensuring safer travel experiences.\nThe dataset comprises 72 dimensions, including Crash Number, City/Town Name, Crash Date, Crash Severity, Crash Time, Crash Year, Maximum Injury Severity Reported, Age of the Youngest Known Driver, and Age of the Oldest Known Driver, among others."

Therefore, through aggregating the number of accidents by hour, the plot can visualize the trend of accidents throughout a day. It is also suitable for using Shiny app which allow users to interact with the plot. There can be a time series bar, when the user drag the button, the plot can show different numbers of accidents in different hours in a day. Also, this plot can help identify peak times for accidents. \n\nVariables to be used and created:\nThe main variables will be used to answer this question are: \n\nAge: which will help to categorize individuals into different groups to see which age group is more involved in accidents\nCrash Time: which will help to determine the times when accidents are most frequent. \n\nThe variables will be created have not yet be determined, but some variables can be considered are: \n\nAge Group: which can categorize individuals into specific age groups, such as 0-18 (youths), 19-35 (young adults), 36- 50 (middle-aged adults), 51-65 (pre-seniors) and 65+ (seniors). There are columns with age groups, but the age can be regrouped so they can be grouped with different categories which allow for a clearer analysis of which age groups seem to be involved in accidents\nDay Part: instead of looking at the specific time,  it is helpful to divide day into different parts like Morning (5am-12:00am), Afternoon (12:01pm - 5:00pm), Evening (5:01pm - 9:00 pm), and Night (9:01 pm - 4:59am). In such a way, not only peak hours but also period of time can used to see when more accidents happen."

By leveraging the extensive data provided by the Tucson Police Department, we aim to analyze various dimensions such as the time, location, and nature of accidents, in addition to identifying high-risk areas and times for collisions. Furthermore, our analysis seeks to explore the impact of environmental and temporal variables—like weather conditions and time of day—on the frequency and severity of accidents.\nIn doing so, we intend to not only highlight critical safety concerns but also to propose data-driven recommendations for enhancing road safety measures in Tucson. Through advanced data visualization techniques and statistical analysis, we plan to make our findings accessible to a broad audience, including local authorities, the university community, and the general public. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the ongoing efforts to reduce traffic-related injuries and fatalities, promoting a safer environment for the residents and visitors of Tucson."
