Our aim is to develop an interactive spatiotemporal visualization to highlight patterns, trends, and hot-spots of traffic accidents in the city. This initiative seeks to leverage data for societal benefit, offering insights that can contribute to improved safety measures and awareness within the Tucson community."

As students at the University of Arizona, located in the heart of Tucson, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to study a subject that directly impacts the community. Analyzing traffic collision data within the city not only allows us to apply the theoretical knowledge we’ve gained in our data analysis courses but also provides insights into urban safety and transportation issues that affect peers and fellow residents. This project is not just an academic exercise; it’s a chance to contribute to a safer, more informed Tucson."

    "section": "Analysis Plan",
    "text": "Analysis Plan\nThe primary objective of our project is to delve deep into the Tucson accident crash dataset to uncover underlying patterns and factors contributing to road accidents within Tucson. By leveraging the extensive data provided by the Tucson Police Department, we aim to analyze how various dimensions such as day, time, injury severity, number of fatalities, and type of violation are all related to each other.\nThe two specific questions we aim to answer are:\n\nQuestion 1\nMembers: Sanja Dmitrovic, Jiayue He, Vidhyananth Sivashanmugam\nDoes day of the week and/or time of day affect severity and the number of accidents?\nVariables to use:\n\nTimeOccu (time at which accident occurred)\nDay (day of week accident occurred)\nInjurySeverity (how serious the injury caused by accident was)\n\nSome additional variables may be used such as:\n\nOperatorImpaired (if the operator was impaired due to substances or other reasons)\nOperatorDistracted (if the operator was distracted)\n\nThese variables may help us explore why certain days of the weeks or times of day lead to more accidents. For example, our hypothesis is that weekend nights would lead to more accidents due to more usage of drugs and alcohol by the driver. This factors could also explain why some accidents are more severe than others.\nPlots to use: To answer this question, we plan to create daily and hourly time series plots to easily observe trends in accident frequency and injury severity. In the Shiny app, there can be a time series bar where the user drags the button and the plot shows the different numbers of accidents in different hours in a day and days in the week.\n\n\nQuestion 2\nMembers: Naitik Shah, Varun Soni, Mohammad Ali Farmani\nWhat is the relationship between the type of violation (e.g., failure to yield, aggressive driving) and if the accident resulted in a fatality?\nVariables to use:\n\nFatalCollision (yes or no if accident resulted in fatality or not)\nTotalFatalities (number of fatalities reported as an integer)\nAll Violation variables which report yes or no (i.e., ViolationSpeed, ViolationTooClose, ViolationTrafficControlDevice, ViolationTurning, ViolationWrongWay, ViolationLane, ViolationFailuretoYield, ViolationCrosswalk, ViolationAggressiveDriving).\n\nPlots to create: For the Shiny app, we will create a series of stacked bar plots that show the number of accidents based the type of violation. Pie charts may be included to provide a high-level summary of the percentage of crashes per violation type.\nIn the end, we aim for the user to hover over various areas in Tucson and see the time series plots and bar plots that give insights to the questions posed above."
